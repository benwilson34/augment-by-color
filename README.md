# Augment By Color
An AR project for poster and business card

This was a project I did with [Megan Barker](www.meganbarkerart.com) for her senior thesis in April 2017. I made use of the lovely [AR.js library](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) maintained by [Jerome Etienne](https://github.com/jeromeetienne).

Her words:
"A visual representation of my grapheme-color synesthesia through 2D animation and open-source, web-based 3D augmented reality."

The poster features white text which is overlaid with 3D colored text when viewed using a mobile phone or tablet (wow!).

The business card, when viewed with a device, shows a 2D image as if it was printed on the card (cool!).
